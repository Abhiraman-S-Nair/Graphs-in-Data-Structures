Graph representation in Data Structures

The graph is a non linear data structure that consists of finite sets of vertices and a bunch of edges connecting with them. 

Graph G is a pair of sets(V,E) where V is the vertices and E sets of edges connecting with the pair of vertices.

GRAPH TERMINOLOGIES

Adjacent Vertices: If there is an edge between two vertices.

Adjacent Edges: If there is a common vertex between two edges.

Degree: In undirected graph, the number of vertices to the vertes is known as degree.

Path: The path is a sequence of distinct vertices such that two consecutive vertices are adjacent.
